# JDBC Basics in Java

This repository contains simple Java programs that demonstrate the basics of JDBC (Java Database Connectivity). It covers how to connect to a database, perform CRUD operations, and use `Statement` and `PreparedStatement` effectively.

## 📚 Topics Covered

- Connecting Java with a database using JDBC
- Performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations
- Using `Statement` vs `PreparedStatement`
- Handling SQL exceptions

## 🗂 Sample Files

- `DemoJdbc.java` – Basic JDBC connection setup
- `CRUDOperations.java` – Full CRUD operation implementation
- `UseOfPreparedStat.java` – Using `PreparedStatement` for secure queries
- `PrblmWithStat.java` – Common issues with `Statement` usage
- `Main.java` – Entry point for running the examples

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Make sure you have a 'JDK' installed and a 'database' (like PostgreSQL or MySQL) running.
2. Update database credentials in the `.java` files as needed.
3. Compile and run any Java file using:

```bash

javac FileName.java
java FileName
